### Paragraph II - Lying to myself. The creative process behind learning R

I admit it. I've lost some sleep while trying to learn R. I felt stupid, I felt that a comma would put me into a coma, but not everything was hard work, highly intellectual tasks and a deep understanding of R. Instead, I would easily say that a big part of it, probably more than I would like to admit, was pure luck and writing bits of code I still don't understand what they really do.

That's the part of science most researchers aren't keen to admit. Science is not something we do while seating in leather chairs, while smoking a cigar and drinking scotch. There's no classical music playing on the background and most researchers have no idea what Marxism is. Part of being a researcher means wearing sweatpants, drinking unhealthy amounts of coffee, and hating your office colleague for typing too loud.

So that somehow creative process doesn't always exist as we imagine it. It's just something which simply happens while watching "The Flash" or while actually working.
