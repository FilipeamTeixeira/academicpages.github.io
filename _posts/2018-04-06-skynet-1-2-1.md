Skynet v1.2.1 is out.

I've decided to not make this a major release as most functions have been "pending" since v1.0.

So what's new?

- **skynet** objects - Now when creating a network with skynet, it automatically generates a skynet object. There are a couple of advantages here, such as being able to use the `summary()` function.

- `boot_net()` - Now it is possible to bootstrap a skynet object and extract the respective confidence intervals.

- New function syntax - In order to comply with a "tidy" world, and with some of the R syntax rules, we changed most function names. For example `make.netDir()` is now `make_net_directed()`.

- The `import_db1b()` and `import_t100()` functions require to import the files with a certain order (i.e. Coupon, Ticket). File naming no longer matters for the import function.

- We improved as well documentation, and the overall skynet's performance.
